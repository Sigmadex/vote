# React Front-End for Voting Platform (SEP-002)

## Summary

This application enables select whitelisted wallet addresses to vote on the SEP-002 proposal.

# How it Works

A user will be able to connect their wallet and place a vote on if their wallet address is whitelisted in the smart contract. Votes will be stored on-chain in an array that can be called through Web3.
